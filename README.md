### Resnet model design and train on CIFAR-10 dataset
- This project explores the development of a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture to achieve high test accuracy on a version of the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset, constrained to a maximum of 5 million trainable parameters.
- The model was designed and trained from scratch, adhering to the competition guidelines, which prohibited the use of pre-trained weights or external datasets.
- Various hyperparameters, including channel count, filter size, kernel size, and pooling strategies, were optimized.
- Techniques such as data augmentation, dropout regularization, and learning rate scheduling were employed to enhance model performance.
- The final architecture achieved competitive accuracy while maintaining parameter efficiency.
